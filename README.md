For more info, see [this tweet thread](https://twitter.com/todbot/status/1428096525217931264).

## Installation

- Copy the entire `screensaver` directory to your CIRCUITPY drive
- See the `demo_code.py` example (or just copy it over as `code.py`) to see how to use it

## Notes

- Assumes CircuitPython 7, but only for `rainbowio`. And should work in CP6.
